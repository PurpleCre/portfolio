# Overview

This is my portfolio built to showcase my skillset and projects.

The web app I wrote is my portfolio website. I wrote it using react and vite so you can start a local server bby running npm run dev in the terminal this will epose a local port where the web app will be available (something like https://localhost:8080/).

I wrote this webapp to test my skills on something I was passionate about

# Web Pages

I have four main pages, namely, Home, ABout, projects, and Contacts. The home page is the landing pag, from them you have multiple CTAs redirecting to the other three pages, there is also a common nav and footer with redirects to a ny of the four pages. On the home page skills and most of the content is dynamically injected, the same is true for the rest of the pages. In the projects page each project is dynamically injected using a template and iterators.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code, and gihub for the deelopment of this webapp.

I used React and TYscript to write this webapp. I also used a variety of libraries, including but not limited to toaster and tolltipprovider.
